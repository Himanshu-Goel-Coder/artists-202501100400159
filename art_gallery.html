                The <b>Mona Lisa</b> painting was created by the Italian Renaissance artist
                <b><u>Leonardo da Vinci</u></b>. He began working on the portrait around 1503,
and it is believed he continued refining it until approximately 1517.
                The painting, which depicts <b>Lisa del Giocondo</b>, the wife of Florentine merchant
                Francesco del Giocondo, is renowned for its enigmatic expression, subtle use of
                sfumato technique, and lifelike quality. It is now housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris,
                where it remains one of the most famous and visited artworks in the world.

                <b>The Starry Night</b> is one of the most famous works by Dutch painter
                <b><u>Vincent van Gogh</u></b>, created in 1889 while he was living in an asylum
in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The painting depicts a swirling night sky filled
                with stars, above a quiet town and rolling hills. The expressive brushwork and bold use
                of color make it a masterpiece of Post-Impressionism. Today, the painting is housed in
                the <b>Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)</b> in New York City.

                <b>The Last Supper</b> is a late 15th-century mural painting by

                in Milan, Italy. It depicts the dramatic scene of Jesus Christ with his twelve apostles
                during the moment he announces that one of them will betray him.
                The composition, perspective, and emotional intensity make it one of the most influential works
                of the Renaissance. Despite deterioration over time, it remains an iconic masterpiece.
